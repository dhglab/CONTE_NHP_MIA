# CONTE_NHP_MIA

<br\>

Maternal immune actiation (MIA) via poly ICLC injection was performed on male non-human primates (Rhesus macaque) at the end of 1st of 2nd trimsester of pregnancy. RNA-sequencing data from 4 year old offsprings was collected from 4 brain regions dorsalateral pre-frontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), hippocampus (HC), and visual cortex (V1) to assess the long term molecular effects of MIA.
