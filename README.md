# CONTE_NHP_MIA

Maternal immune actiation (MIA) via poly ICLC injection was performed on non-human primates (Rhesus macaque) at the end of 1st of 2nd trimsester. RNA-sequencing data was collected from 4 brain regions dorsalateral pre-frontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), hippocampus (HC), and visual cortex (V1) to assess the long term molecular effect of MIA.
